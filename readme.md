# This is my classification analysis for an assignment in Machine Learning
- This assignment is about predicting what type of customers that would subscribe to a cross-sell promotion.

This analysis will:
- Analyze data
- Develop insights
- Build Machine Learning Models to predict the cross-sell success.

 **This repository consists of 4 files in the respective order:**
 1. Dictionary for the different variables in the dataset.
 2. The analysed dataset.
 3. The Python code
 4. The insight report. 
 
 **I will be redoing this analysis at some point, given the code is messy and sometimes unclear.**
